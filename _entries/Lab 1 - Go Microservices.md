# Lab 1 - Go Microservices

### Estimated Duration: 90 minutes

## Overview

Microservices is an architectural style where applications are composed of small, independently deployable services that communicate over a network. Each service focuses on a specific business function, allowing for scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance. Microservices enhance development speed and resilience by enabling teams to work on individual components without affecting the entire system. Now that you have your environment provisioned and the prerequisites fulfilled, it is time to start working on the labs.

Go is a fast, simple, and efficient programming language by Google, ideal for building scalable, cloud-native applications. With features like goroutines for concurrency, strong typing, and powerful built-in tools, Go enables rapid development and deployment. In the ARO lab, it’s used to build and containerize microservices with MongoDB integration, showcasing its strengths in cloud and microservice environments.

## Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Application Overview (READ-ONLY)
- Task 2: Connect to the cluster
- Task 3: Create Project
- Task 4: Deploy MongoDB
- Task 5: Deploy Ratings API
- Task 6: Deploy Ratings frontend

## Task 2: Connect to the cluster

In this task, you will log into the cluster using the `kubeadmin` user.  

1. Run the following command on **Azure Cloud Shell** to find the password for the `kubeadmin` user. 
   - Replace $CLUSTER_NAME with **ARO<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>** (your OpenShift cluster name)
   - $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME with **openshift** (the resource group name).

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az aro list-credentials \
     --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
     --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
   ```

2. The following example output shows the password will be in `kubeadminPassword`.

   ```json
   {
      "kubeadminPassword": "<generated password>",
      "kubeadminUsername": "kubeadmin"
   }
   ```

   ![](../media/redhatl1.png)

3. **Save** these secrets in a notepad, you are going to use them to connect to the Web Portal.

## Task 3: Create Project

In this task, you will login to the web console, retrieve the login command and token and create a project.

### Login to the web console

Each Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster has a public hostname that hosts the OpenShift Web Console.

1. Use the command `az aro list` to list the clusters in your current Azure subscription.

   ```sh
   az aro list -o table
   ```

2. You'll see the cluster web console URL. Open it in a new browser tab, log in with the `kubeadmin` user and the password you retrieved earlier, and click **Log in**.

## Task 4: Deploy MongoDB

In this task, you will create mongoDB from Docker hub, verify if the mongoDB pod was created successfully and retrieve mongoDB service hostname

### Create mongoDB from Docker hub

Azure Red Hat OpenShift allows you to deploy a container image from Docker hub easily and we will deploy a MongoDB database service this way. The mandatory environment variables (user, password, database name etc.) can be passed in the ``oc new-app`` command line

1. Deploy the MongoDB database:

    ```sh
    oc new-app bitnami/mongodb \
      -e MONGODB_USERNAME=ratingsuser \
      -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=ratingspassword \
      -e MONGODB_DATABASE=ratingsdb \
      -e MONGODB_ROOT_USER=root \
      -e MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=ratingspassword
    ```

   ![Create new project](../media/redhatl5.png)

2. Now, go back to the web console and switch to **Developer** mode. Click on the three horizontal lines **(☰) (1)** in the top left corner, then select **Administrator (2)**, and finally, click on **Developer (3)**.

   ![Developer settings](../media/developer-settings.png)

   >**Note:** If you see Welcome to the Developer Perspective!. You can choose **Skip tour**.

   ![Developer settings](../media/redhatl6.png)

1. Switch to the **workshop** project, you should see a new deployment for mongoDB.

### Verify if the mongoDB pod was created successfully

1. Run the `oc get all` command to view the status of the new application and verify if the deployment of the mongoDB template was successful.

    ```sh
    oc get all
    ```

   ![oc status](../media/oc-status-mongodb.png)

### Retrieve mongoDB service hostname

1. Find the mongoDB service.

    ```sh
    oc get svc mongodb
    ```

   ![oc get svc](../media/oc-get-svc-mongo.png)

1. The service will be accessible at the following DNS name: `mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`. This resolves only within the cluster.

1. Copy and paste the **CLUSTER IP** os the mongodb service, you'll need this IP addrress to import the ratings data in the next task to configure the `rating-api`.

1. You can also retrieve this from the web console. 

   ![MongoDB service in the Web Console](../media/mongo-svc-webconsole.png)

## Task 5: Deploy Ratings API

In this task, you will fork the application to your own GitHub repository, use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-api`, configure the required environment variables, verify that the service is running, load data into Mongodb database, retrieve `rating-api` service hostname, setup GitHub webhook and update rating-api Target Port.

The `rating-api` is a NodeJS application that connects to mongoDB to retrieve and rate items. Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

- `rating-api` on GitHub: <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api>
- The container exposes port 8080
- MongoDB connection is configured using an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI`

### Fork the application to your own GitHub repository

1. To be able to setup CI/CD webhooks, you'll need to fork the application into your personal GitHub repository.

<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api/fork" data-icon="octicon-repo-forked" data-size="large" aria-label="Fork MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api on GitHub">Fork</a>

<validation step="a2110909-a71b-4cba-8adb-f1dfd3c6a9a4" />

### Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-api`

> **Note** You're going to be using [source-to-image (S2I)](#source-to-image-s2i) as a build strategy.

```sh
oc new-app https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api --strategy=source --name=rating-api
```

![Create rating-api using oc cli](../media/oc-newapp-ratingapi.png)

### Configure the required environment variables

1. Create the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable. This URI should look like `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]:27017/ratingsdb`. You'll need to replace the `[usernaame]` and `[password]` with the ones you used when creating the database. You'll also need to replace the `[endpoint]` with the hostname acquired in the previous step

1. Hit **Save** when done.

   ![Create a MONGODB_URI environment variable](../media/rating-api-envvars.png)

1. It can also be done with CLI

    ```
    oc set env deploy/rating-api MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb
    ```

### Verify that the service is running

If you navigate to the logs of the `rating-api` deployment, you should see a log message confirming the code can successfully connect to the mongoDB.
For that, in the deployment's details screen, click on *Pods* tab, then on one of the pods

![Verify mongoDB connection](../media/rating-api-working.png)

### Load data into Mongodb database

1. Clone the `ratings-api` repo by running the following command and navigate into the specific directory.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api
    cd mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api/
    ```

1. Get the pods. You'll specifically use the mongodb pod name to connect to the remote shell on the pod.

    ```sh
    oc get pods
    ```

   ![](../media/oc-get-pods.png)

1. Copy the data folder into the mongoDB pod. Replace the **$MONGODB-POD-NAME** with the actual pod name.

    ```sh
    oc cp ./data $MONGODB-POD-NAME:/tmp/
    ```

1. Connect to the remote shell on the pod. Replace the **$MONGODB-POD-NAME** with the actual pod name.

    ```sh
    oc rsh $MONGODB-POD-NAME
    ```

   ![](../media/oc-rsh.png)

1. Run the `mongoimport` command to import the JSON data files into the database. Replace the **$MONGODB-CLUSTER-IP** with the actual mongodb service when you ran the command `oc get svc mongodb` in the previous task and verify that all the documents have been imported successfully.

    ```sh
    mongoimport --host $MONGODB-CLUSTER-IP --username ratingsuser --password ratingspassword --db ratingsdb --collection items --type json --file /tmp/data/items.json --jsonArray
    ```

    ```sh
    mongoimport --host $MONGODB-CLUSTER-IP --username ratingsuser --password ratingspassword --db ratingsdb --collection sites --type json --file /tmp/data/sites.json --jsonArray
    ```

    ```sh
    mongoimport --host $MONGODB-CLUSTER-IP --username ratingsuser --password ratingspassword --db ratingsdb --collection ratings --type json --file /tmp/data/ratings.json --jsonArray
    ```

   ![](../media/import-data.png)

1. `Exit` the remote shell.

    ```sh
    exit
    ```

### Retrieve `rating-api` service hostname

1. Find the `rating-api` service.

    ```sh
    oc get svc rating-api
    ```

1. The service will be accessible at the following DNS name over port 8080: `rating-api.workshop.svc.cluster.local:8080` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`. This resolves only within the cluster.

### Setup GitHub webhook

1. To trigger S2I builds when you push code into your GitHib repo, you'll need to setup the GitHub webhook.

1. Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger secret. You'll need use this secret in the GitHub webhook URL.

    ```sh
    oc get bc/rating-api -o=jsonpath='{.spec.triggers..github.secret}'
    ```

1. You'll get back something similar to the below. Make note the secret key in the red box as you'll need it in a few steps.

   ![Rating API GitHub trigger secret](../media/rating-api-github-secret.png)

1. Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger URL from the build configuration.

    ```sh
    oc describe bc/rating-api
    ```

   ![Rating API GitHub trigger url](../media/rating-api-github-webhook-url.png)

1. Replace the `<secret>` placeholder with the secret you retrieved in the previous step to have a URL similar to `https://api.otyvsnz3.eastus.aroapp.io:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/workshop/buildconfigs/rating-api/webhooks/SECRETSTRING/github`. You'll use this URL to setup the webhook on your GitHub repository.

1. In your GitHub repository, select **Add Webhook** from **Settings** → **Webhooks**.

1. Paste the URL output (similar to above) into the Payload URL field.

1. Change the Content Type from GitHub’s default **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** to **application/json**.

1. Click **Add webhook**.

   ![GitHub add webhook](../media/rating-api-github-addwebhook.png)

1. You should see a message from GitHub stating that your webhook was successfully configured.

1. Now, whenever you push a change to your GitHub repository, a new build will automatically start, and upon a successful build a new deployment will start.

   > **Resources**
   > * [ARO Documentation - Triggering builds](https://docs.openshift.com/aro/4/builds/triggering-builds-build-hooks.html)

### Update rating-api Target Port

1. Run the following command to edit the `rating-api` service runinng on the namepsace/project named **workshop**.

    ```sh
    oc edit svc rating-api -n workshop
    ```

1. You'll now update the 8080 port to `3000` port.

## Task 6: Deploy Ratings frontend

In this task, you will fork the application to your own GitHub repository, modify Dockerfile in your repository, use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-web`, configure the required environment variables, expose the `rating-web` service using a Route, try the service, setup GitHub webhook and make a change to the website app and see the rolling update.

The `rating-web` is a NodeJS application that connects to the `rating-api`. Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

- `rating-web` on GitHub: <https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web>
- The rating-web frontend Dockerfile needs modification to the image to run on ARO 4.x versions
- The container exposes port 8080
- The web app connects to the API over the internal cluster DNS, using a proxy through an environment variable named `API`

### Fork the application to your own GitHub repository

To be able to setup CI/CD webhooks, you'll need to fork the application into your personal GitHub repository.

<a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web/fork" data-icon="octicon-repo-forked" data-size="large" aria-label="Fork MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web on GitHub">Fork</a>

<validation step="9e829e84-c475-424f-9cde-e5e8cd9a873e" />

### Modify Dockerfile in your repository

> **Note** The Dockerfile needs to be modified to use the correct node.js image to build correctly.

> **Note** The `git` commands shown below have been run in a local shell pre-authenticated against the GitHub repository

1. Clone the Git repository locally and change to repo directory

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web.git
    cd mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web

The build will take between 5-10 minutes

![Create rating-web using oc cli](../media/oc-newapp-ratingweb.png)

### Configure the required environment variables

Create the `API` environment variable for `rating-web` Deployment Config. The value of this variable is going to be the hostname/port of the `rating-api` service.

Instead of setting the environment variable through the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Web Console, you can set it through the OpenShift CLI.

```sh
oc set env deploy rating-web API=http://rating-api:8080

```

### Expose the `rating-web` service using a Route

1. Expose the service.

   ```sh
   oc expose svc/rating-web
   ```

1. Find out the created route hostname

   ```sh
   oc get route rating-web
   ```

1. You should get a response similar to the below.

   ![Retrieve the created route](../media/oc-get-route.png)

Notice the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is comprised of the application name and project name by default. The remainder of the FQDN, the subdomain, is your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster specific apps subdomain.

### Try the service

Open the hostname in your browser, you should see the rating app page. Use **http://** port and not **https://** port to open the hostname in your browser. Play around, submit a few votes and check the leaderboard.

![rating-web homepage](../media/rating-web-homepage.png)

### Setup GitHub webhook

1. To trigger S2I builds when you push code into your GitHib repo, you'll need to setup the GitHub webhook.

   ![Cluster console page](../media/cluster-console.png)

### Create network policy

1. You will create a policy that applies to any pod matching the `app=rating-api` label. The policy will allow ingress only from pods matching the `app=rating-web` label.

1. Use the YAML below in the editor, and make sure you're targeting the **workshop** project.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: api-allow-from-web
     namespace: workshop
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         app: rating-api
     ingress:
       - from:
           - podSelector:
               matchLabels:
                 app: rating-web
   ```

   ![Create network policy](../media/create-networkpolicy.png)

1. Click **Create**.
